# Reversi-AI-NonDeepLearning

Construct an AI for Reversi using only non-deep learning methods(use alpha betha pruning) that interact with the provided environment (reversi.py, reversi_server.py, greedy_player.py)

## Rules:

- Standard Reversi rules (Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReversiLinks to an external site.)
- Except white goes first instead of black.
- Code must be written in Python
- No multi-threading
- No machine learning
- No more than 5 seconds per hand.

## To Use:

Please simply run the code with no arguments, just like the greedy_player.py
